## Requirements

### Hardware:
- Google Cardboard Headset
- Luxonis OAK-D
- Host Computer (Windows or Linux-based)

### Sofware:
- [DepthAI API](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai)
- numPy
- OpenCV2 (3+)
- [imutils](https://github.com/PyImageSearch/imutils)
- tKinter

## How It Works

![Pipeline of the projection system](./assets/pipeline.png)

I utilized various image processing techniques to reach a reliable projection method.

The first component is the HSV-based segmentation method, which is a fairly simple method of segmentation. We use OpenCV's `inRange` function, which can be calibrated with `picker.py`.

The next component is a convolution that reduces the ganularity of the segmentation mask. This way we can get a shape that is less sensitive to pixel-wise changes.

The last component is a method to find a rectangle from the reduced mask. From then, it is just a simple distortion (barrel distortion) and split screen filter to create a VR-like view.

Since all of this is happening on the laptop, we would want to stream it to the display (a phone) via MJPEG streaming, which just uses a HTML webpage.
