## Requirements

### Hardware:
- Google Cardboard Headset
- Luxonis OAK-D
- Host Computer (Windows or Linux-based)

### Sofware:
- [DepthAI API]()
- numPy
- OpenCV2 (2+)
- imutils
- tKinter

## How It Works

![Pipeline of the projection system](./assets/pipeline.png)

I utilized various image processing techniques to each a reliable projection method. The first component would be the HSV-based segmentation method, which is a fairly simple method of segmentation. The next components are simply to reduce the complexity of the features from the segmentation masks and a method to find a rectangle from the reduced mask. From then, it is just a simple distortion and split screen filter to create a VR-like view. Since all of this is happening on the laptop, we would want to stream it to the display (a phone) via MJPEG streaming, which just uses a HTML webpage.
